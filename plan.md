# Detailed Implementation Plan for Birth Control Application

This plan outlines changes and additions needed in our existing Next.js codebase (using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/UI components) to implement a comprehensive birth control application. The app will include features such as cycle tracking, birth control reminders, health monitoring, educational content, and anonymous community support. Data persistence is provided via localStorage using a custom hook and utility functions with robust error handling.

---

## 1. New Pages and Routes

Create new folders (if not existing) under the `/src/app` directory and add the following pages:

### a) Dashboard (`/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose:** Landing page that displays an overview of the user’s cycle status, upcoming reminders, and recent health logs.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Import the `Navbar` component.
  - Use React state to fetch data from localStorage (via a custom hook or utils).
  - Display summary cards (e.g., next predicted ovulation, upcoming reminders).
  - Use Tailwind CSS for a modern, clean layout with proper spacing and typography.

### b) Cycle Tracking (`/src/app/cycle/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose:** Allow users to log menstrual cycle details and see predictions for ovulation, fertile & safe days.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Build a form with inputs (e.g., start date, cycle length, symptoms) using components from `/src/components/ui/input.tsx` and `/src/components/ui/button.tsx`.
  - Validate inputs (e.g., date format, numeric values) and handle errors with try-catch.
  - Calculate predictions using basic algorithms and display dynamic results.
  - Save and retrieve cycle data using the custom localStorage hook.

### c) Reminders (`/src/app/reminders/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose:** Enable users to set up birth control reminders (pill, injection, condom tracking).
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create a form for multiple reminder types with inputs for schedule (date/time).
  - Validate and store reminders in localStorage.
  - List upcoming reminders dynamically and allow deletion or editing with robust error handling.

### d) Health Monitoring (`/src/app/health/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose:** Log symptoms (mood, cramps, headaches) and track weight/BMI.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Develop a multi-field form to record daily health metrics.
  - Optionally integrate the existing `/src/components/ui/chart.tsx` for visualizing trends.
  - Validate entries and catch JSON parsing errors when accessing localStorage.
  - Provide clear error messages if data input is invalid.

### e) Education (`/src/app/education/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose:** Present educational articles on family planning, contraceptive methods, FAQs, and myth-busting content.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Use an accordion component (from `/src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`) to list articles and FAQs.
  - Format text with clean typography and spacing; no external images are required.
  - Hardcode or load static JSON content for educational articles.

### f) Community / Support (`/src/app/community/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose:** Offer an anonymous Q&A forum and an optional “connect to doctors” feature.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Build a form for submitting anonymous questions.
  - Display a list of user-posted questions stored locally.
  - Optionally add a “Connect to Doctors” section with a simple form or mailto link.
  - Ensure proper validations and error messaging.

### g) Error Boundary (`/src/app/error.tsx`)
- **Purpose:** Provide a user-friendly error page for runtime issues.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Implement a custom error component that catches errors globally.
  - Display a simple, modern error message with suggestions (e.g., “Please try again later”).

## 2. New Components

### a) Navigation Bar (`/src/components/Navbar.tsx`)
- **Purpose:** A responsive, modern navigation bar available on all pages.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Use Next.js `Link` components to link to `/dashboard`, `/cycle`, `/reminders`, `/health`, `/education`, and `/community`.
  - Style using Tailwind CSS (clear typography, spacing, and layout).
  - Avoid external icon libraries; use text labels and styled buttons.

---

## 3. New Hooks and Utility Functions

### a) Custom Local Storage Hook (`/src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`)
- **Purpose:** Encapsulate localStorage logic with error handling and fallback state.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create a hook that exposes `getItem`, `setItem`, and `removeItem` operations.
  - Use try-catch blocks for JSON parse/stringify errors.
  - Return default values if localStorage is unavailable.

### b) Extended Utility Functions (`/src/lib/utils.ts`)
- **Purpose:** Provide helper functions to persist and retrieve data for cycles, reminders, and health logs.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Add functions like `saveCycleData(data: object)`, `getCycleData(): object`, `saveReminders(data: object)`, and `getReminders()`.
  - Incorporate error handling within these functions to catch potential failures in data storage/retrieval.

---

## 4. Styling, UI/UX, and Best Practices

- **Modern UI Elements:**  
  - Use clean and spacious layouts with consistent typography and color schemes defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
  - Ensure that forms, buttons, and input fields display appropriate validation feedback.
- **Error Handling & Validation:**  
  - Validate all user inputs on the client side; display clear error messages when incorrect data is submitted.
  - Use try-catch blocks around localStorage operations and JSON parsing.
- **Responsiveness:**  
  - Ensure that the Navbar and pages are responsive across devices using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.
- **Code Reuse:**  
  - Leverage existing UI components from `/src/components/ui/` for consistency and reduced duplication.

---

## 5. Testing and Validation

- **LocalStorage Testing:**  
  - Manually test saving/retrieval of cycle data, reminders, and health metrics via browser console.
- **Form Inputs:**  
  - Verify input validations using deliberate invalid entries and check if user-friendly messages are shown.
- **Navigation:**  
  - Use browser navigation to ensure all links in `Navbar` work and render the correct components.
- **Error Boundaries:**  
  - Simulate errors in a development environment to confirm that `/src/app/error.tsx` displays correctly.

---

## AI & Future Enhancements

- **AI Integration:**  
  - No direct AI/LLM integration is implemented at this phase. Future enhancements can utilize LLMs via providers (e.g., OpenRouter) for features like advanced personalized educational content or dynamic Q&A support.
- **Provider & API Endpoints:**  
  - As of now, the application is purely client-side using localStorage; any future backend or AI integrations will require updating the API endpoints and adding necessary keys.

---

## Summary

- New pages for Dashboard, Cycle Tracking, Reminders, Health Monitoring, Education, Community, and an Error Boundary are created under `/src/app`.
- A responsive Navbar component (`/src/components/Navbar.tsx`) is added for seamless navigation.
- A custom hook (`/src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`) and extended utility functions in `/src/lib/utils.ts` ensure robust local data persistence with error handling.
- Each feature page includes modern, minimalist UI elements styled with Tailwind CSS and incorporates client-side validation.
- The implementation is designed as a fully functional frontend prototype with room for future AI or backend enhancements.
